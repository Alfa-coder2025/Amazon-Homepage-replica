The project is a website designed to replicate the Amazon's homepage using HTML and CSS. The layout is structured into several key sections, each serving a specific purpose:​

Navigation Bar: This top section includes elements like the Amazon logo, location selector, search bar, language options, sign-in button, returns and orders link, and shopping cart icon.​

Hero Section: A large, visually appealing area designed to grab the user's attention, often featuring promotional content or key messages.​

Product Categories: A section displaying various product categories in a box layout, each represented by images.​

Footer: The bottom section of the page containing additional  company information, and legal disclaimers.​

The design utilizes Flexbox for layout control, ensuring responsiveness and alignment across different screen sizes. Hover effects are also implemented to enhance interactivity.
